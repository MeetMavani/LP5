# LP5 DL 

## Linear Reg

Absolutely! Here's an explanation of every line in your code like you're 5 years old — simple and clear:

🧠 "We're building a tiny brain (model) that looks at house details and tries to guess how much each house costs."

📦 Step 1: Getting our toys (importing tools)

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
These lines say:

“Hey Python, I need help from my friends — pandas (pd), numpy (np), tensorflow, keras, sklearn, and matplotlib.”

Each one is good at something:

pandas: reading and playing with data tables (like Excel).

numpy: doing math.

tensorflow/keras: building brains (models).

sklearn: helping with data splitting and scaling.

matplotlib: drawing pictures.

📂 Step 2: Getting our data (uploading a file)

python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
👦 "Let me open my bag and pull out my notebook (boston.csv) that has all the house info."

📑 Step 3: Reading and checking the data

python
Copy
Edit
data = pd.read_csv('boston.csv')
data.columns
We read the file called 'boston.csv' using pandas.

Then we peek at the column names — like looking at the labels on jars in your kitchen.

🏗️ Step 4: Splitting into inputs and answers

python
Copy
Edit
X = data.drop('Price', axis=1)
y = data['Price']
X = everything except “Price” (like number of rooms, area, etc.).

y = just the “Price” column (this is what we want to guess).

👦 Think of it like: “Here are the questions (X), and here are the answers (y).”

📏 Step 5: Scaling the data (making numbers behave)

python
Copy
Edit
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
We make all numbers in X roughly the same size (like making all toys the same size so our model doesn’t get confused by big numbers).

✂️ Step 6: Dividing into training and testing sets

python
Copy
Edit
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
We split the data:

80% for learning (train)

20% for testing (test)

Like practicing with most of the questions, and saving a few to test yourself later.

🧠 Step 7: Building the model (tiny brain)

python
Copy
Edit
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.Input(shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
We build a very simple model:

One input layer that takes in the features.

One output layer (just 1 neuron) that gives us the price.

Like a machine that looks at the info and gives us one number — the price.

🔧 Step 8: Telling it how to learn

python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
We tell the model:

Use the “Adam” optimizer (a smart way to adjust weights).

“mse” (mean squared error) is the way we check how wrong it is.

“mae” (mean absolute error) is also a way to measure how far off we are (but simpler).

🏃‍♂️ Step 9: Training the model

python
Copy
Edit
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)
We train (teach) the model for 100 rounds.

20% of training data is used to check if it's learning well (validation).

verbose=0 just means “don’t show training progress.”

📊 Step 10: Testing the model

python
Copy
Edit
loss, mae = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
Now we give it new questions (X_test) and see how close its answers are to the real prices (y_test).

🔮 Step 11: Making predictions

python
Copy
Edit
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred[0:10]
We ask the model to predict the prices of the test houses.

Then we look at the first 10 guesses.

🖼️ Step 12: Drawing the results

python
Copy
Edit
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel("Actual Prices")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Prices")
plt.title("Actual VS Predicted House Prices")
plt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], color='red')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
We draw a picture:

Each dot is a house.

If the dot is close to the red line, our guess was good!

Red line = perfect prediction.


## Binary class

📦 1. Load the Data
python
Copy
Edit
from keras.datasets import imdb
This brings in a magical box of movie reviews. These reviews are already labeled as "good" or "bad" by grown-ups.

python
Copy
Edit
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=10000)
We open the magic box and take out two big piles of movie reviews:

X_train = reviews we use to teach the computer.

y_train = answers (0 = bad, 1 = good).

X_test & y_test = new reviews and answers to test if our computer learned properly.

We only use the 10,000 most common words to keep it simple.

🧱 2. Make All Reviews the Same Size
python
Copy
Edit
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
We import a tool that helps us make all LEGO walls the same size.

python
Copy
Edit
X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=200)
X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=200)
Some reviews are short, some are long. We make them all exactly 200 words long by:

Cutting the long ones.

Filling the short ones with zeros.

This helps our model not get confused by different sizes.

🏗️ 3. Build the Model
python
Copy
Edit
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Embedding, Flatten, Dense
We're bringing in tools to build a smart machine (model) layer by layer — like stacking LEGO blocks.

python
Copy
Edit
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=16, input_length=200),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
Let’s build it:

Embedding:

Takes word numbers (like 5, 321, 9999) and turns them into small 16-number vectors (word meanings!).

Like giving LEGO blocks magical meanings instead of just numbers.

Flatten:

Smashes all those vectors into one long line so we can feed it to the next layer.

Like unfolding a LEGO cube into a straight line.

Dense(16, relu):

16 tiny brains (neurons) that try to learn patterns.

relu = if the number is negative, make it zero (helps learning).

Dense(1, sigmoid):

One final neuron that gives us a number between 0 and 1 (how likely the review is good).

sigmoid = makes sure the output looks like a probability.

⚙️ 4. Tell the Model How to Learn
python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
We tell the model:

Use adam (a smart way to improve).

Use binary_crossentropy to check how wrong it is (because we only have 2 choices: good/bad).

Track accuracy (how many times it guessed right).

🏃 5. Teach the Model
python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=512, validation_split=0.2)
Now we train the model — like teaching a kid with flashcards:

Do it 5 times (epochs).

Show 512 reviews at a time (batch size).

Keep 20% of data for testing during training (validation_split).

🧪 6. Test the Model
python
Copy
Edit
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
We check if the model learned well by testing it on new reviews.

loss = how wrong it is.

acc = how often it’s right.

🔮 7. Make Predictions
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred_prob = model.predict(X_test)
The model looks at test reviews and says:

"I'm 90% sure this one is good."

"I'm 30% sure this one is good."

✅ 8. Turn Probabilities into Answers
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred_class = (y_pred_prob > 0.5).astype('int')
If it’s more than 0.5, we say it’s good (1).
If it’s less, we say it’s bad (0).
Like drawing a line: above = yes, below = no.

🧾 9. See Some Results
python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Actual : {y_test[i]} Predicted : {y_pred_class[i][0]}")
We print the first 10 reviews:

What the real answer was.

What our model guessed.

ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let me explain your code like you're 5 years old — using super simple words and examples 😊

🚀 Let's Learn Step-by-Step What Each Line Does
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
👶 "Hey computer, I need help working with tables!"
So we ask Pandas (a tool) to help us read and use data like it's a spreadsheet.

python
Copy
Edit
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.utils import to_categorical
👶 "I want to make a robot brain!"
We bring in tools from Keras that help us build the brain (model) with layers, and also help us convert answers into a robot-friendly way (numbers instead of letters).

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
👶 "Let’s split our toys into training and testing piles."
We use Scikit-learn to:

Split data into practice data (train) and test data (to check how smart our robot got).

Turn letters into numbers so the robot can understand them.

📦 Load and Prepare Data
python
Copy
Edit
data = pd.read_csv('letter-recognition.data', header=None)
👶 "Open my toy box!"
This reads a file full of A to Z letters and numbers that describe how they look.

python
Copy
Edit
X = data.iloc[:, 1:].values
y = data.iloc[:, 0].values
👶 "Take the letter out and keep the numbers!"

X = the numbers that describe each letter.

y = the actual letter (like 'A', 'B', etc.).

🔢 Turn Letters into Numbers
python
Copy
Edit
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
y_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(y)
👶 "Let’s change 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, ..., 'Z' to 25."
The robot can’t read letters, so we turn them into numbers.

python
Copy
Edit
y_categorical = to_categorical(y_encoded)
👶 "Make it easier for the robot by using switches!"
This makes one-hot encoding:
If the answer is 'C' (which becomes 2), we make it like:
[0, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0] → Only 1 switch is ON, the rest are OFF.

✂ Split Data for Practice and Testing
python
Copy
Edit
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y_categorical, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)
👶 "Let the robot practice with some toys, and we’ll hide the rest to test it later."
We keep:

80% for training (robot learning)

20% for testing (robot quiz)

🧠 Build the Brain (Model)
python
Copy
Edit
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, input_shape = (16,), activation = 'relu'),
    Dense(64, activation = 'relu'),
    Dense(26, activation = 'softmax')
])
👶 "Make a brain with 3 layers!"

The robot takes in 16 numbers (each letter is described using 16 features).

First two layers: 64 brain cells that learn using ReLU (a smart way to decide).

Final layer: 26 outputs (for A–Z) using softmax (picks the best one like: “Hmm… 90% sure it’s B!”)

⚙ Compile the Brain
python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])
👶 "Tell the robot how to learn!"

Use Adam (a smart learning helper).

Use categorical_crossentropy to see how far off its guesses are.

Track accuracy to see how many guesses are right.

🏋 Train the Robot
python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 5, batch_size = 32, validation_split = 0.1)
👶 "Train for 5 rounds, 32 toys at a time, and check every round with some hidden toys!"

The robot learns again and again (5 times).

It trains on most data and checks with a small chunk (10%) to make sure it’s doing okay.

📊 Test the Robot
python
Copy
Edit
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy : ", acc)
👶 "Give the robot the quiz and see how smart it got!"
We give the test data and see how many answers it got right (accuracy).

🤖 Make Predictions
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
👶 "Robot, guess the answers!"
It looks at the test letters and gives predictions.

🔍 Find the Best Guess
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred_labels = y_pred.argmax(axis = 1)
👶 "Pick the guess with the highest score!"
From something like [0.1, 0.8, 0.05, ...], it picks index 1 (which may be 'B').

⚠ Bug in the Code
python
Copy
Edit
y_true_labels = y_test.argmax)ax
👶 Uh oh! This line has a typo 🐞
It should be:

python
Copy
Edit
y_true_labels = y_test.argmax(axis = 1)
👶 This line says:
"Hey, what were the real answers? Pick the 1 from [0, 0, 1, 0, ...]!"

📦 Step 1: Get the data of clothes
python
Copy
Edit
from keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
👉 “Hey computer, go grab a bunch of pictures of clothes!”
This brings in a built-in dataset from Keras with images of clothes like T-shirts, sneakers, pants, etc.

🧠 Step 2: Make the brain (model) and helper tools
python
Copy
Edit
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
Sequential → "I want to build the brain step by step, one layer at a time!"

to_categorical → “Let’s turn label numbers like 0, 1, 2 into special math format (like [0, 0, 1, 0…]) so the computer can understand better.”

Dense, Flatten → “Tools to build brain layers: Flatten makes image flat like a line, and Dense is a thinking layer with neurons.”

🖼️ Step 3: Load the images of clothes
python
Copy
Edit
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
👉 “Split the clothes into two baskets: one for learning (train) and one for testing later (test). Each basket has pictures (X) and labels (y).”

🧽 Step 4: Clean and prepare the images
python
Copy
Edit
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_test = X_test / 255.0
👉 “Each picture has numbers from 0 to 255. Let’s make them smaller (0 to 1), so it’s easier for the brain to work with.”

🎨 Step 5: Turn labels into colors (one-hot)
python
Copy
Edit
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
👉 “If the label was just ‘3’, now we change it to something like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. One number is 1, the rest are 0.”

🧱 Step 6: Build the brain
python
Copy
Edit
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape = (28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation = 'relu'),
    Dense(10, activation = 'softmax')
])
👉 “Let’s build the brain in 3 parts:”

Flatten: Make each 28x28 image into 784 numbers in a line.

Dense 128 (relu): A thinking layer with 128 smart brain cells (neurons).

Dense 10 (softmax): The output layer. It says how sure it is about each of the 10 types of clothes.

🛠️ Step 7: Tell the brain how to learn
python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])
👉 “Use the Adam helper to learn, and measure how wrong (loss) the brain is, and how often it's right (accuracy).”

📚 Step 8: Teach the brain
python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 5, batch_size = 32, validation_split = 0.1, verbose = 0)
👉 “Let’s show it the clothes 5 times (epochs), 32 pictures at a time. Use 10% of data to check if it’s learning well.”

verbose = 0 means “Don’t talk while learning.”

🧪 Step 9: Test how smart the brain is
python
Copy
Edit
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
👉 “Okay brain, now look at new pictures you haven’t seen. How well do you do?”

🔮 Step 10: Make predictions
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
👉 “Hey brain, what do you think these clothes are?” It gives back probabilities for each clothing class.

🎯 Step 11: Pick the highest guess
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred_class = y_pred.argmax(axis = 1)
y_true_class = y_test.argmax(axis = 1)
👉 “Choose the biggest number from the predictions — that’s the brain’s guess. Do the same for the real answers too.”

👕 Step 12: Name the classes
python
Copy
Edit
classes = ['Dress', 'Coat', 'Jeans', 'Ankle Boot', 'Trouser', 'T-shirt', 'Pant', 'Shirt', 'Pullover', 'Sneaker']
👉 “Let’s give each number a name so we can read what it is.”

👁️ Step 13: Show some guesses
python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(15):
    print(f"Actual Fashion Class : {classes[y_true_class[i]]}\tPredicted Fashion Class : {classes[y_pred_class[i]]}")
👉 “Show the real name and what the brain guessed for the first 15 pictures.”

🔍 Step 14: Peek at test data and predictions
python
Copy
Edit
y_test[0:20]
y_pred_class[0:20]
y_pred[0 : 20]
👉 “Just looking at the first 20 real answers, predicted classes, and probabilities.”
